# Learning101
 A space for my students to learn and practice Unity. The current Editor version is **2022.3.49f**, so anything after that (Unity 6 not tested) should be compatible- and even as early as **v.3.20**. No promises lol.
## Purpose
- Make Unity and C# more approachable throughout the semesters and my time at SAE.
- Teach Open Source basics and general Version Control stuff.
🐱‍💻
- Simple _Base_ for any Unity projects you may need to work with in the future.
- Have fun lol!
## Contributing
If you want to contribute to this thing, simply just update your code, create a [pull request](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-pull-request-in-github/), and I'll review it. The goal is to create a very BASIC unity project, with some cool features and good practices so be mindful.
